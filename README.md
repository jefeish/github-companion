### This is Max, a speech bot!

Max is a GitHub Companion (App) that notifies you on events, verbally. Hopefully making it more fun to keep up with GitHub notifications.

## Quickstart

### Install this App a regular [GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/managing-github-apps/installing-github-apps)

`Max` needs to run on your local system in order to "speak" to you. We recommend that you run it locally in **Dev mode** (`npm run dev`), or **Normal** mode (`npm start`).

## What does it look like?!
